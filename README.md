The goal of kerneval is to estimate probability densities from data that are affected by observation bias, e.g. length bias.

## Installation

The kerneval package is in development and only available on GitHub for the time being. Later versions will be submitted to CRAN. In the meantime, you can install kerneval with:

``` r
devtools::install_github('GwenAntell/kerneval')
